## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Working students and regular students struggle with time management due to competing demands (sleep, work, studies). Current task managers don't account for realistic available time or provide intelligent budgeting. TYMATE solves this by:

1. **Modeling available time like a bank account** — showing remaining hours after accounting for sleep and daily commitments
2. **Providing real-time awareness** — dynamic status messages adapt to time of day
3. **Intelligent analytics** — identifying procrastination patterns, time estimation accuracy, and per-category performance
4. **Smart recommendations** — AI-generated improvement tips based on user behavior

### Core Concept
Just like a bank account shows balance, deposits, and withdrawals:
- **Balance**: How many free hours you have left today
- **Budget**: Your total available time (calculated from sleep and wake time)
- **Spent**: Hours you've logged to tasks

TYMATE adapts to your **wake time and bedtime**, showing realistic remaining hours throughout the day.

## Emerging Technology

### AI-Powered Analytics Engine

**What it does:**
- Analyzes user task completion patterns over 30 days
- Generates personalized recommendations based on behavior
- Calculates procrastination score (0-100 scale)
- Estimates time accuracy for future planning

**Why chosen:**
- Provides value-added insights beyond basic task tracking
- Helps students improve time estimation and planning
- Demonstrates pattern recognition & data analysis skills
- Suitable for academic/personal projects without heavy ML infrastructure

**Implementation:**
- Built using Python's `statistics` module (mean, median, stdev)
- Heuristic-based rules (not deep learning)
- Runs locally; no external API calls
- Analyzes completion timing, category performance, and accuracy

**Limitations:**
- Requires historical data (30 days minimum for accurate insights)
- Cannot predict external factors (illness, emergencies)
- Limited to rule-based recommendations (not probabilistic ML)
- May be inaccurate with small sample sizes

**Code location:** [services/analytics_engine.py](services/analytics_engine.py)

## Risks & Constraints

### Technical Constraints
| Constraint | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Flet UI Testing | Cannot automate test UI with pytest | Manual testing + comprehensive test data |
| SQLite Scalability | Single file database | Suitable for <100 users (academic project) |
| No Real-Time Sync | Local-first design only | Document as future enhancement |
| bcrypt vs AES-256 | No database-level encryption | bcrypt passwords sufficient for scope |

### Identified Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Password verification failure | Low | High | Implemented bcrypt sync in tests |
| Data loss (no backup) | Low | Medium | Soft deletes retain historical data |
| Session timeout edge cases | Low | Low | 30-min configurable timeout |
| Profile photo upload errors | Medium | Low | 5MB limit + format validation |
| Time calculation errors | **Medium** | **Medium** | **Known issue**: Incorrect calculations with edge cases (e.g., 5 hours sleep, 5-11am wake time). Documented as future fix. |

**NOTE**: Check out **[Security Report](docs/SECURITY_REPORT.md)** for a more extensive discussion regarding app security.

### Future Enhancements
- ☐ SQLCipher for database encryption
- ☐ Cloud backup (Google Drive, Dropbox integration)
- ☐ Real-time notifications (when overdue)
- ☐ Recurring tasks
- ☐ Manual and In-App Time Logging for Tasks
- ☐ Work Time and Schedule considerations
- ☐ Collaborative task sharing
- ☐ Mobile app (iOS/Android native)
- ☐ Advanced ML-based predictions
- ☐ Dark mode theme

## Reflections

### Jessica Lanuzo - Full Stack Developer

*So, Flet continued to prove to be a really good choice for developing apps; I only needed to be familiar with it (or just consult the documentation often), and I could do just about everything with my knowledge of coding in Python. And as I am still relatively new to developing on my own, references and bases are also really important in being able to build my own things efficiently.* 

*My circumstances led me to have an iterative workflow of (1) running through several of the software functionalities based on when it will appear or be used and (2) going back to the first uncommitted one and reviewing it before pushing into my GitHub repository. This, funnily, led to code conflicts even though I was working on my own because I did local version saving (can’t even call it ‘control’) before commits. But it was also somehow very fitting for my situation, because if I committed everything at once, I don’t think I would’ve reviewed them anymore later…* 

*Here, instead of my usual habit of overthinking the whole thing, I focused on the app flow and decided on things based on how I experienced it when doing the test runs.*
